# Lab 1: Connect to the Workstation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab you will be able to:

- Connect to the Ubuntu lab desktop through the hosted Remote Access console.
- Open Visual Studio Code and use the integrated terminal on linux-host.
- Verify workstation identity using basic shell commands.

## Time Budget

{{ time_budget(total=15, segments=[[5,"Console & desktop"],[7,"VS Code & terminal"],[3,"Verify shell"]]) }}

## Prerequisites

- [ ] You can sign in to the hosted lab environment and open **Remote Access** (or equivalent) for this workbook.
- [ ] You have a modern browser; pop-up blockers are disabled or allow-listed for the lab portal if your site requires it.

## Procedure

You will use the **linux-host** Ubuntu desktop and its integrated terminal for all following labs. Choose **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop** unless your facilitator directs otherwise.

### Step 1: Open the lab VM console

1. From the lab environment, select **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop** (recommended) or **Win11** if you must use Windows for this session.
2. Open **VM Console** from the **Remote Access** menu (wording may vary slightly by platform).

3. On Windows, if you see “You’re almost done setting up your PC,” choose **Remind me in 3 days** to reach the desktop.

Wait until you see the desktop background and can move the pointer inside the VM.

### Step 2: Orient yourself on the desktop

Alternatively, if you chose **Ubuntu 24.04 Desktop**, you will see a desktop similar to this:

### Step 3: Open Visual Studio Code and the integrated terminal

1. Open **Visual Studio Code** from the applications menu or the dock.
2. Open the integrated terminal (**Terminal → New Terminal** or the shortcut shown in your environment).

3. Stay in this terminal for command examples in later labs.

### Step 4: Confirm the workstation hostname

Run:

```bash
hostname
```

{{ expected_output(landmark="linux-host") }}

*Expected output:*

```text
linux-host
```

If the name differs, ask your facilitator—some environments use a different label, but the workflow is the same.

{% if instructor %}
!!! tip "Instructor"
    **Duration:** ~12 min with a warm VPN. **FAQs:** Black console—refresh VM console; no VS Code—Activities search. **Breaks:** Stale Remote Access—new private window.
{% endif %}

## Verification

Confirm you are on **linux-host** and the shell is responsive. Run these in order in the same terminal:

```bash
hostname
whoami
pwd
```

{{ expected_output(landmark="linux-host") }}

*Expected output:*

```text
linux-host
cisco
/home/cisco
```

## Common Errors

{{ common_errors_start() }}

{{ common_error(
  "Black or frozen VM console after Remote Access.",
  "Browser session timed out, GPU acceleration glitch, or console tab lost focus.",
  "Refresh the Remote Access page, close other heavy tabs, and reopen VM Console. If it persists, snapshot-restore per Reset the Lab."
) }}

{{ common_error(
  "Integrated terminal in VS Code does not open or closes immediately.",
  "VS Code started before the desktop session finished loading, or extension host crashed.",
  "Quit VS Code fully and reopen from the menu. If needed, use an external terminal app temporarily and continue Lab 2 from there."
) }}

{{ common_errors_end() }}

If the desktop or console is unusable after these steps, restore the lab VM snapshot and retry. For the full reset playbook, see **[Reset the Lab](reset-lab.md)**.
